    <h2>
      I. <i>MR. AND MRS. EDWARD ROBERTS; THE CHOREWOMAN</i>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mrs. Roberts, with many proofs of an afternoon&rsquo;s shopping in her hands and
      arms, appears at the door of the ladies&rsquo; room, opening from the public
      hall, and studies the interior with a searching gaze, which develops a few
      suburban shoppers scattered over the settees, with their bags and
      packages, and two or three old ladies in the rocking-chairs. The
      Chorewoman is going about with a Saturday afternoon pail and mop, and
      profiting by the disoccupation of the place in the hour between the
      departures of two great expresses, to wipe up the floor. She passes near
      the door where Mrs. Roberts is standing, and Mrs. Roberts appeals to her
      in the anxiety which her failure to detect the object of her search has
      awakened: &ldquo;Oh, I was just looking for my husband. He was to meet me here
      at ten minutes past three; but there don&rsquo;t seem to <i>be </i>any
      gentlemen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Chorewoman: &ldquo;Mem?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Roberts: &ldquo;I was just looking for my husband. He was to meet me here
      at ten minutes past three; but there don&rsquo;t seem to be any gentlemen. You
      haven&rsquo;t happened to notice&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Chorewoman: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a gentleman over there beyant, readin&rsquo;, that&rsquo;s
      just come in. He seemed to be lukun&rsquo; for somebody.&rdquo; She applies the mop to
      the floor close to Mrs. Roberts&rsquo;s skirts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Roberts, bending to the right and to the left, and then, by standing
      on tiptoe, catching sight of a hat round a pillar: &ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s Mr. Roberts,
      of course. I&rsquo;ll just go right over to him. Thank you ever so much. Don&rsquo;t
      disturb yourself!&rdquo; She picks her way round the area of damp left by the
      mop, and approaches the hat from behind. &ldquo;It <i>is</i> you, Edward! What a
      horrid idea I had! I was just going to touch your hat from behind, for
      fun; but I kept myself from it in time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts, looking up with a dazed air from the magazine in his hand: &ldquo;Why,
      what would have happened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Roberts: &ldquo;Oh, you know it mightn&rsquo;t have been <i>you</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts: &ldquo;But it <i>was</i> I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Roberts: &ldquo;Yes, I know; and I was perfectly sure of it; you&rsquo;re always
      so prompt, and I always wonder at it, such an absent-minded creature as
      you are. But you came near spoiling everything by getting here behind this
      pillar, and burying yourself in your book that way. If it hadn&rsquo;t been for
      my principle of always asking questions, I never should have found you in
      the world. But just as I was really beginning to despair, the Chorewoman
      came by, and I asked her if she had seen any gentleman here lately; and
      she said there was one now, over here, and I stretched up and saw you. I
      had such a fright for a moment, not seeing you; for I left my little plush
      bag with my purse in it at Stearns&rsquo;s, and I&rsquo;ve got to hurry right back;
      though I&rsquo;m afraid they&rsquo;ll be shut when I get there, Saturday afternoon,
      this way; but I&rsquo;m going to rattle at the front door, and perhaps they&rsquo;ll
      come&mdash;they always stay, some of them, to put the goods away; and I
      can tell them I don&rsquo;t want to buy anything, but I left my bag with my
      purse in it, and I guess they&rsquo;ll let me in. I want you to keep these
      things for me, Edward; and I&rsquo;ll leave my shopping-bag; I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t want it
      any more. Don&rsquo;t lose any of them. Better keep them all in your lap here
      together, and then nobody will come and sit on them.&rdquo; She disburdens
      herself of her packages and parcels, and arranges them on her husband&rsquo;s
      knees, while she goes on talking. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m almost ready to drop, I&rsquo;m so tired,
      and I do believe I should let you go up to Stearns&rsquo;s for me; but you
      couldn&rsquo;t describe the bag so they would recognize it, let alone what was
      in it, and they wouldn&rsquo;t give it to you, even if they would let you in to
      inquire: they&rsquo;re much more likely to let a lady in than a gentleman. But I
      shall take a coupe, and tell the driver simply to fly, though there&rsquo;s
      plenty of time to go to the ends of the earth and back before our train
      starts. Only I should like to be here to receive the Campbells, and keep
      Willis from buying tickets for Amy and himself, and us, too, for that
      matter; he has that vulgar passion&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know where he&rsquo;s picked it
      up&mdash;for wanting to pay everybody&rsquo;s way; and you&rsquo;d never think of your
      Hundred-Trip ticket-book till it was too late. Do take your book out and
      hold it in your hand, so you&rsquo;ll be sure to remember it, as soon as you see
      Willis. You had better keep saying over to yourself, &lsquo;Willis&mdash;Hundred-Trip
      Tickets&mdash;Willis&mdash;Hundred-Trip Tickets;&rsquo; that&rsquo;s the way <i>I</i>
      do. Where <i>is</i> the book? I have to remember everything! <i>Do</i>
      keep your ticket-book in your hand, Edward, till Willis comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts: &ldquo;But I want to read, Agnes, and I&rsquo;ve got to hold my <i>Pop. Sci.</i>
      with one hand and keep your traps in my lap with the other. Did you find a
      cook?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Roberts, with rapturous admiration of him: &ldquo;Well, Edward, you <i>have</i>
      got a brain! I declare, the cook had utterly gone out of my mind.
      Forgetting that plush bag makes me forget everything. I&rsquo;ve got a splendid
      one&mdash;a perfect treasure. She won&rsquo;t do any of the wash, and we&rsquo;ll have
      to put that out; and she&rsquo;s been used to having a kitchen-maid; but she
      said we were such a small family that she could shell the pease herself.
      She&rsquo;s the most respectable-looking old thing you ever saw; and she&rsquo;s been
      having ten dollars a week from the last family she was in; but she&rsquo;ll come
      the summer with us for six. I was very fortunate to get her; all the good
      girls are snapped up for the sea-side in May, and they won&rsquo;t go into the
      country for love or money. It was the greatest chance! She&rsquo;s such a neat,
      quiet, lady-like person, and all the better for being Irish and a
      Catholic: Catholics <i>do</i> give so much more of a flavor; and I never
      could associate that Nova Scotia, sunken-cheeked leanness of Maria&rsquo;s with
      a cook. This one&rsquo;s name is&mdash;well, I forget what her name is; Bridget,
      or Norah, or something like that&mdash;and she&rsquo;s a perfect little
      butter-ball. She&rsquo;s coming to go out on the same train with us; and she&rsquo;ll
      get the dinner to-night; and I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t have the mortification of sitting
      down to a pickup meal with Amy Campbell, the first time she has visited
      us; she&rsquo;s conceited enough about her house-keeping as it is, I&rsquo;m sure, and
      I wouldn&rsquo;t have her patronizing and pitying me for worlds. The cook will
      be here at half-past three precisely; I had to pretend the train started a
      little earlier than it does so as to make her punctual; they <i>are</i>
      such uncertain things! and I don&rsquo;t suppose I shall be back by that time,
      quite, Edward, and so you must receive her. Let me see!&rdquo; She glances up at
      the clock on the wall. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just quarter-past now, and our train goes at
      ten minutes to four&mdash;My goodness! I&rsquo;ll have to hurry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Colored Man who cries the trains, walking half-way into the room and
      then out: &ldquo;Cars ready for Cottage Farms, Longwood, Chestnut Hill,
      Brookline, Newton Centre, Newton Highlands, Waban, Riverside, and all
      stations between Riverside and Boston. Circuit Line train now ready on
      Track No. 3.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Roberts, in extreme agitation: &ldquo;Good gracious, Edward, that&rsquo;s our
      train!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts, jumping to his feet and dropping all her packages: &ldquo;No, no, it
      isn&rsquo;t, my dear! That&rsquo;s the Circuit Line train: didn&rsquo;t you hear? Ours
      doesn&rsquo;t go till ten to four, on the Main Line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Roberts: &ldquo;Oh yes, so it does. How ridiculous! But now I <i>must</i>
      run away and leave you, or I never shall get back in time. Be sure to
      speak to the cook as soon as she comes in, or she&rsquo;ll get discouraged and
      go away again; you can&rsquo;t depend on them for an instant; I told her <i>you</i>
      would be here to meet her, if I wasn&rsquo;t&mdash;I thought I might be late;
      and you mustn&rsquo;t let her slip. And if the Campbells happen to get here
      before I&rsquo;m back, don&rsquo;t you give them the least inkling of our having just
      engaged a cook. I&rsquo;m going to smuggle her into the house without Amy&rsquo;s
      knowing it; I wouldn&rsquo;t have her know it for the world. She prides herself
      on keeping that impudent, spoiled thing of hers, with her two soups; and
      she would simply never stop crowing if she knew I&rsquo;d had to change cooks in
      the middle of the summer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts, picking up and dropping the multitudinous packages, and finally
      sitting down with them all in his lap, very red and heated: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be
      careful, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Roberts: &ldquo;How flushed you are, bending over! You&rsquo;re so stout now, you
      ought to bend sidewise; it&rsquo;s perfect folly, your trying to bend <i>straight</i>
      over; you&rsquo;ll get apoplexy. But now I <i>must</i> run, or I shall never be
      back in the world. Don&rsquo;t forget to look out for the cook!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts, at whom she glances with misgiving as she runs out, holding the
      parcels on his knees with both elbows and one hand, and contriving with
      the help of his chin to get his magazine open again: &ldquo;No, no; I won&rsquo;t, my
      dear.&rdquo; He loses himself in his reading, while people come and go
      restlessly. A gentleman finally drops into the seat beside him, and
      contemplates his absorption with friendly amusement.

    <h2>
      II. <i>ROBERTS AND WILLIS CAMPBELL</i>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Campbell: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind <i>me,</i> Roberts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts, looking up: &ldquo;Heigh? What! Why, Willis! Glad to see you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Campbell: &ldquo;Now that you <i>do</i> see me, yes, I suppose you are. What
      have you got there that makes you cut all your friends?&rdquo; He looks at
      Roberts&rsquo;s open page. &ldquo;Oh! <i>Popular Science Monthly.</i> Isn&rsquo;t Agnes a
      little afraid of your turning out an agnostic? By-the-way, where <i>is</i>
      Agnes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts: &ldquo;She left her purse at Stearns&rsquo;s, and she&rsquo;s gone back after it.
      Where&rsquo;s Amy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Campbell: &ldquo;Wherever she said she wouldn&rsquo;t be at the moment. I expected to
      find her here with you and Agnes. What time did you say your train
      started?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts. &ldquo;At ten minutes to four. And, by-the-way&mdash;I&rsquo;d almost
      forgotten it&mdash;I must keep an eye out for the cook Agnes has been
      engaging. She was to meet us here before half-past two, and I shall have
      to receive her. You mustn&rsquo;t tell Amy; Agnes doesn&rsquo;t want her to know she&rsquo;s
      been changing cooks; and I&rsquo;ve got to be very vigilant not to let her give
      us the slip, or you won&rsquo;t have any dinner to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Campbell: &ldquo;Is that so? Well, that interests <i>me.</i> Were you expecting
      to find her in the <i>Pop. Sci.</i>?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts: &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;d only been reading a minute when you came in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Campbell: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you know how long you&rsquo;d been reading. Very
      likely your cook&rsquo;s come and gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts, with some alarm: &ldquo;She couldn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;d only just opened the book.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Campbell: &ldquo;I dare say you <i>think</i> so. But you&rsquo;d better cast your
      eagle eye over this assemblage now, and see if she isn&rsquo;t here; though
      probably she&rsquo;s gone. What sort of looking woman is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts, staring at him in consternation: &ldquo;Bless my soul! I don&rsquo;t know! I
      never saw her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Campbell: &ldquo;Never saw her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts: &ldquo;No; Agnes engaged her at the intelligence-office, and told her
      we should meet her here, and she had to go back for her purse, and left me
      to explain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Campbell: &ldquo;Ha, ha, ha! Ha, ha, ha! How did she expect you to recognize
      her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts: &ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sure. She&mdash;she was very anxious I
      shouldn&rsquo;t let her get away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Campbell, laughing: &ldquo;You poor old fellow! What are you going to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ve no idea. Agnes&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Campbell: &ldquo;Agnes ought to have a keeper. You know what I&rsquo;ve always thought
      of <i>your</i> presence of mind, Roberts; but Agnes&mdash;I&rsquo;m really
      surprised at Agnes. This is too good! I must tell Amy this. She&rsquo;ll never
      get over this. Ah, ha, ha, ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts: &ldquo;No, no! You mustn&rsquo;t, Willis. Agnes would be very much provoked
      with me, if you told Amy she had been engaging a cook. She expects to
      smuggle her into the house without Amy&rsquo;s knowing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Campbell: &ldquo;And she left you to meet her here, and keep her&mdash;a cook
      you&rsquo;d never set eyes on! Ha, ha, ha, ha! Ah, ha, ha, ha! What&rsquo;s her name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts: &ldquo;Agnes couldn&rsquo;t remember her last name&mdash;one never remembers
      a cook&rsquo;s last name. Her first name is Norah or Bridget.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Campbell: &ldquo;Maggie, perhaps; they all sound alike. Ah, ha, ha! Ha, ha, ha!
      This improves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Willis; you&rsquo;ll attract attention. What&mdash;what shall I
      do? If Agnes comes back, and finds I&rsquo;ve let the cook get away, she&rsquo;ll be
      terribly put out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Campbell: &ldquo;Perfectly furious, you poor old fellow!&mdash;the rage of a
      disappointed pigeon! I wouldn&rsquo;t be in your shoes for anything. Oh my! I
      wish Amy was here. Did&mdash;did&mdash;Agnes&rdquo;&mdash;(he struggles with his
      laughter, and explodes from time to time between syllables)&mdash;&ldquo;did she
      tell you how the woman looked?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts: &ldquo;She said she was a very respectable-looking old thing&mdash;a
      perfect butter-ball. I suppose she was stout.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Campbell: &ldquo;That covers the ground of a great many cooks. They&rsquo;re apt to
      look respectable when they&rsquo;re off duty and they&rsquo;re not in liquor, and
      they&rsquo;re apt to be perfect butter-balls. Any other distinctive traits?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts, ruefully: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. She&rsquo;s Irish, and a Catholic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Campbell: &ldquo;They&rsquo;re apt to be Irish, and Catholics too. Well, Roberts, I
      don&rsquo;t see what you can ask better. All you&rsquo;ve got to do is to pick out a
      respectable butter-ball of that religion and nationality, and tell her
      you&rsquo;re Mrs. Roberts&rsquo;s husband, and you&rsquo;re to keep her from slipping away
      till Mrs. Roberts gets here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts: &ldquo;Oh, pshaw, now, Willis! What would you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Campbell: &ldquo;<i>There&rsquo;s</i> a respectable butter-ball over in the corner by
      the window there. You&rsquo;d better go and speak to her. She&rsquo;s got a gingham
      bundle, like a cook&rsquo;s, in her lap, and she keeps looking about in a
      fidgety way, as if she expected somebody. I guess that&rsquo;s your woman,
      Roberts. Better not let her give you the slip. You&rsquo;ll never hear the last
      of it from Agnes if you do. And who&rsquo;ll get our dinner to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts, looking over at the woman in the corner, with growing conviction;
      &ldquo;She does answer to the description.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Campbell: &ldquo;Yes, and she looks tired of waiting. If I know anything of that
      woman&rsquo;s character, Roberts, she thinks she&rsquo;s been trifled with, and she&rsquo;s
      not going to stay to be made a fool of any longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts, getting to his feet: &ldquo;Do you think so? What makes you think so?
      Would you go and speak to her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Campbell: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. She seems to be looking this way. Perhaps she
      thinks she recognizes <i>you</i>, as she never saw you before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts: &ldquo;There can&rsquo;t be any harm in asking her? She does seem to be
      looking this way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Campbell: &ldquo;Pretty blackly, too. I guess she&rsquo;s lost faith in you. It
      wouldn&rsquo;t be any use to speak to her now, Roberts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;d better. I must. How would you
      introduce the matter, Willis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Campbell: &ldquo;Oh, I wouldn&rsquo;t undertake to say! I must leave that entirely to
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts: &ldquo;Do you think I&rsquo;d better go at it boldly, and ask her if she&rsquo;s
      the one; or&mdash;or&mdash;approach it more gradually?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Campbell: &ldquo;With a few remarks about the weather, or the last novel, or a
      little society gossip? Oh, decidedly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts: &ldquo;Oh, come, now, Willis! What would you advise? You must see it&rsquo;s
      very embarrassing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Campbell: &ldquo;Not the least embarrassing. Simplest thing in the world!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Colored Man who calls the Trains, coming and going as before: &ldquo;Cars
      for Newton, Newtonville, West Newton, Auburndale, Riverside, Wellesley
      Hills, Wellesley, Natick, and South Framingham. Express to Newton. Track
      No. 5.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Campbell: &ldquo;Ah, she&rsquo;s off! She&rsquo;s going to take the wrong train. She&rsquo;s
      gathering her traps together, Roberts!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and speak to her.&rdquo; He makes a sudden dash for the woman
      in the corner. Campbell takes up his magazine, and watches him over the
      top of it, as he stops before the woman, in a confidential attitude. In a
      moment she rises, and with a dumb show of offence gathers up her
      belongings and marches past Roberts to the door, with an angry glance
      backward at him over her shoulder. He returns crestfallen to Campbell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Campbell, looking up from his magazine, in affected surprise: &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s
      your cook? You don&rsquo;t mean to say she was the wrong woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts, gloomily: &ldquo;She wasn&rsquo;t the right one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Campbell: &ldquo;How do you know? What did you say to her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts: &ldquo;I asked her if she had an appointment to meet a gentleman here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Campbell: &ldquo;You <i>did</i>? And what did she say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts: &ldquo;She said &lsquo;No!&rsquo; very sharply. She seemed to take it in dudgeon;
      she fired up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Campbell: &ldquo;I should think so. Sounded like an improper advertisement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts, in great distress: <i>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t</i>, Willis, for Heaven&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Campbell: &ldquo;Why, you must see it had a very clandestine look. How did you
      get out of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts: &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t. I got into it further. I told her my wife had made an
      appointment for me to meet a cook here that she&rsquo;d engaged&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Campbell: &ldquo;You added insult to injury. Go on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts: &ldquo;And that she corresponded somewhat to the description; and&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Campbell: &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts: &ldquo;And she told me she was no more a cook than my wife was; and she
      said she&rsquo;d teach me to be playing my jokes on ladies; and she grabbed up
      her things and flew out of the room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Campbell; &ldquo;Waddled, <i>I</i> should have said. But this is pretty serious,
      Roberts. She may be a relation of John L. Sullivan&rsquo;s. I guess we better
      get out of here; or, no, we can&rsquo;t! We&rsquo;ve got to wait for Amy and Agnes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts: &ldquo;What&mdash;what would you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Campbell: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Look here, Roberts: would you mind sitting a
      little way off, so as to look as if I didn&rsquo;t belong with you? I don&rsquo;t want
      to be involved in this little row of yours unnecessarily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts: &ldquo;Oh, come now, Willis! You don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;ll make any trouble? I
      apologized. I said everything I could think of. She <i>must</i> think I
      was sincere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Campbell: &ldquo;In taking her for a cook? I&rsquo;ve no doubt she did. But I don&rsquo;t
      see how that would help matters. I don&rsquo;t suppose she&rsquo;s gone for an
      officer; but I suspect she&rsquo;s looking up the largest Irishman of her
      acquaintance, to come back and interview you. I should advise you to go
      out and get on some train; I&rsquo;d willingly wait here for Amy and Agnes; but
      you see the real cook might come here, after you went, and I shouldn&rsquo;t
      know her from Adam&mdash;or Eve. See?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts, desperately. &ldquo;I see&mdash;Good heavens! Here comes that woman
      back; and a man with her. Willis, you must help me out.&rdquo; Roberts gets
      falteringly to his feet, and stands in helpless apprehension, while Mr.
      and Mrs. McIlheny bear down upon him from the door. Mr. McIlheny, a small
      and wiry Irishman, is a little more vivid for the refreshment he has
      taken. He is in his best black suit, and the silk hat which he wears at a
      threatening slant gives dignified impressiveness to his figure and
      carriage. With some dumb-show of inquiry and assurance between himself and
      his wife, he plants himself in front of Roberts, in an attitude equally
      favorable for offence and defence.

      III. <i>THE McILHENYS, ROBERTS, AND CAMPBELL</i>
    </h2>
    <p>
      McIlheny: &ldquo;And are ye the mahn that&rsquo;s after takun&rsquo; my wife for yer cuke?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. McIlheny, indicating Campbell, absorbed in his magazine: &ldquo;And there&rsquo;s
      the other wan I saw jokun&rsquo; wid um, and puttun&rsquo; um up to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McIlheny, after a swift glance at Campbell&rsquo;s proportions and
      self-possession: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what ye&rsquo;re after thinkun&rsquo;, Mary; but I haven&rsquo;t
      got annything to do with what ye&rsquo;re after thinkun&rsquo;. All I wannt to know is
      what this mahn meant by preshumin&rsquo; to speak to a lady he didn&rsquo;t know, and
      takun&rsquo; her for a cuke.&rdquo; To Roberts: &ldquo;Will ye tell me that, ye&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts, in extreme embarrassment: &ldquo;Yes, yes, certainly; I shall be very
      glad to explain, if you&rsquo;ll just step here to the corner. We&rsquo;re attracting
      attention where we are&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McIlheny: &ldquo;Attintion! Do ye suppose I care for attintion, when it&rsquo;s me
      wife that&rsquo;s been insulted?&rdquo; He follows Roberts up, with Mrs. McIlheny, as
      he retires to the corner where she had been sitting, out of the way of the
      people coming and going. Campbell, after a moment, closes his magazine,
      and joins them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roberts: &ldquo;Insulted? By no manner of means! Nothing was further from my
      thoughts. I&mdash;I&mdash;can explain it all in a moment, my dear sir, if
      you will have patience; I can indeed. I have the highest respect for the
      lady, and I&rsquo;m quite incapable of offering her an affront. The fact is&mdash;I
      hardly know how to begin&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McIlheny: &ldquo;Go ahn, sor; or I&rsquo;ll have to do the beginnun&rsquo; meself, pretty
      soon.&rdquo; He shifts himself from one foot to another with a saltatory
      briskness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roberts: &ldquo;The fact is, my wife had engaged a cook, up-town, and she had
      sent her down here to meet me, and go out with me to our summer place at
      Weston.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McIlheny: &ldquo;An&rsquo; fwhat has all that rigamarole to do wid your speakin&rsquo; to a
      lady ye&rsquo;d never been inthrojuced to? Fwhat had yer wife&rsquo;s cuke to do with
      Mrs. McIlheny?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts: &ldquo;Why, I didn&rsquo;t know the cook by sight, you see. My wife had
      engaged her up-town, and appointed her to meet me here, without reflecting
      that I had never seen her, and wouldn&rsquo;t know who she was, when I <i>did</i>
      see her; she partly expected to be here herself, and so I didn&rsquo;t reflect,
      either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McIlheny, with signs of an amicable interest: &ldquo;An&rsquo; she lift ye to mate a
      lady ye never had seen before, and expicted ye to know her by soight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts: &ldquo;Precisely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McIlheny, smiling: &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s loike a wooman, Mary; ye can&rsquo;t say it
      ain&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. McIlheny, grinning: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s loike a mahn, too, Mike, by the same
      token.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McIlheny: &ldquo;Sure it&rsquo;s no bad joke on ye, sor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Campbell, interposing: &ldquo;I was having my laugh at him when your good lady
      here noticed us. You see, I know his wife&mdash;she&rsquo;s my sister&mdash;and
      I could understand just how she would do such a thing, and&mdash;ah, ha,
      ha, ha, ha! Ha, ha, ha! I don&rsquo;t think I shall ever get over it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McIlheny: &ldquo;Sure it <i>is</i> good! Hu, hu, hu, hu! Mary, it&rsquo;s what ye&rsquo;d
      call a bull, if it was Irish, I&rsquo;m thinkun&rsquo;; an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s no bad bull as it is,
      my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. McIlheny, laughing: &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re right there, Mike. It&rsquo;s as fine a bull as
      ever there was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Campbell: &ldquo;And my friend here insisted on going over and speaking to the
      lady, in hopes she could help him out of the difficulty. I suppose he
      bungled it; he only wanted to ask her if she&rsquo;d seen a cook here, who had
      an appointment to go out of town with a gentleman. I&rsquo;d been joking him
      about it, and he thought he must do something; and I fancy he made a mess
      of it. He was a good deal worked up. Ha, ha, ha! Ah, ha, ha, ha!&rdquo; Mr. and
      Mrs. McIlheny join in his laugh, and finally Roberts himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colored Man who calls the Trains, coming and going: &ldquo;Cars for
      Auburndale, Riverside, Pine Grove, and Newton Lower Falls. Express to
      Auburndale, Track No. 7.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. McIlheny: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s our train. Mike! Come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McIlheny: &ldquo;So &lsquo;tis, Mary! Well, I&rsquo;m hawpy to make yer acquaintance,
      gentlemen; and if ye&rsquo;re ever in the City Hahl when the Council is sittun&rsquo;,
      and ye&rsquo;ll send in yer names to Mike McIlheny, I&rsquo;ll be pl&rsquo;ased to show ye
      ahl the attintion in me power. Ye must excuse me <i>now</i>; we&rsquo;re jist
      runnun&rsquo; out to the Fahls to pass Sunday at a cousin&rsquo;s of Mrs. McIlheny&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
       He snakes hands with Roberts and Campbell, and runs out, followed by his
      wife.

    <h2>
      IV. <i>ROBERTS AND CAMPBELL</i>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Campbell: &ldquo;Distinguished public character. Well, we&rsquo;re out of that,
      Roberts. I had to crowd the truth a little for you, but I fetched the
      belligerent McIlheny. What are you going in for next?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts: &ldquo;I&mdash;upon my word, I haven&rsquo;t the least idea. I think I shall
      give up trying to identify the cook. Agnes must do it herself when she
      comes here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Campbell: &ldquo;Oh no! <i>That</i> won&rsquo;t do, old fellow. The cook may come here
      and give you the slip before Agnes gets back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts: &ldquo;What would you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Campbell: &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know; I don&rsquo;t like to advise, exactly; but it
      seems to me you&rsquo;ve got to keep trying. You&rsquo;ve got to keep your eye out for
      respectable butter-balls, and not let them slip through your fingers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts: &ldquo;You mean, go up and speak to them? I <i>couldn&rsquo;t</i> do that
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Campbell: &ldquo;Well, of course you didn&rsquo;t make a howling success with Mrs.
      McIlheny; but it wasn&rsquo;t a dead-failure either. But you must use a little
      more diplomacy&mdash;lead up to the subject gently. Don&rsquo;t go and ask a
      woman if she&rsquo;s a cook, or had an appointment to meet a gentleman here. <i>That</i>
      won&rsquo;t do. I&rsquo;ll tell you! You might introduce the business by asking if she
      had happened to see a lady coming in or going out; and then describe
      Agnes, and say you had expected to meet her here. And she&rsquo;ll say she
      hadn&rsquo;t seen her here, but such a lady had just engaged her as a cook. And
      then you&rsquo;ll say you&rsquo;re the lady&rsquo;s husband, and you&rsquo;re sure she&rsquo;ll be in in
      a moment. And there you are! That&rsquo;s the way you ought to have worked it
      with Mrs. McIlheny. Then it would have come out all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts, pessimistically: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how it would have made her the
      cook.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Campbell: &ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t have done that, of course; but it would have done
      everything short of that. But we&rsquo;re well enough out of it, anyway. It was
      mighty lucky I came in with my little amendment just when I did. There&rsquo;s
      all the difference in the world between asking a lady whether she <i>is</i>
      a cook and whether she&rsquo;s <i>seen</i> a cook. That difference just saved
      the self-respect of the McIlhenys, and saved your life. It gave the truth
      a slight twist in the right direction. You can&rsquo;t be too careful about the
      truth, Roberts. You can&rsquo;t offer it to people in the crude state; it&rsquo;s got
      to be prepared. If you&rsquo;d carried it through the way I wanted you to, the
      night you and old Bemis garroted each other, you&rsquo;d have come out perfectly
      triumphant. What you want is not the <i>real</i> truth, but the <i>ideal</i>
      truth; not what you <i>did,</i> but what you <i>ought</i> to have done.
      Heigh? Now, you see, those McIlhenys have gone off with their
      susceptibilities in perfect repair, simply because I substituted a <i>for</i>
      for an <i>if,</i> and made you inquire <i>for</i> a cook instead of <i>if</i>
      she was a cook. Perhaps you did ask for instead of ask if?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts: &ldquo;No, no. I asked her if she <i>was</i> a cook.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Campbell: &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad the McIlhenys had too much sense to believe
      that. They&rsquo;re happy, anyway. They&rsquo;re enjoying the hobble that you and
      Agnes are in, with lofty compassion. They&mdash;hello! here&rsquo;s that fellow
      coming back again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts: &ldquo;Who? Which? Where?&rdquo; He starts nervously about, and confronts Mr.
      McIlheny bearing down upon him with a countenance of provisional severity.
    </p>
    <p>
      McIlheny: &ldquo;Just wan word more wid you, sor. Mrs. McIlheny has been
      thinkun&rsquo; it oover, and she says you didn&rsquo;t ask her if she was after <i>seeun</i>
      a cuke, but whether she was after <i>beun&rsquo;</i> a cuke? Now, sor, which
      wahs ut? Out wfd ut! Don&rsquo;t be thinkun&rsquo; ye can throw dust in our eyes
      because we&rsquo;re Irishmen!&rdquo; A threatening tone prevails in Mr. McIlheny&rsquo;s
      address at the mounting confusion and hesitation in Roberts. &ldquo;Come! are ye
      deef, mahn?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts, in spite of Campbell&rsquo;s dumb-show inciting him to fiction: &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;if
      you will kindly step apart here, I can explain. I was very confused when I
      spoke to Mrs. McIlheny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McIlheny, following him and Willis into the corner: &ldquo;Fwhat made ye take my
      wife for a cuke? Did she luke anny more like a cuke than yer own wife? Her
      family is the best in County Mayo. Her father kept six cows, and she never
      put her hands in wather. And ye come up to her in a public place like
      this, where ye&rsquo;re afraid to spake aboove yer own breath, and ask her if
      she&rsquo;s after beun&rsquo; the cuke yer wife&rsquo;s engaged. Fwhat do ye mane by ut?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts: &ldquo;My dear sir, I know&mdash;I can understand how it seems
      offensive; but I can assure you that I had no intention&mdash;no&mdash;no&mdash;&rdquo;
       he falters, with an imploring glance at Campbell, who takes the word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Campbell: &ldquo;Look here, Mr. McIlheny, you can appreciate the feelings of a
      gentleman situated as my friend was here. He had to meet a lady whom he
      had never seen before, and didn&rsquo;t know by sight; and we decided&mdash;Mrs.
      McIlheny was so pleasant and kindly looking&mdash;that he should go and
      ask her if she had seen a lady of the description he was looking for, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McIlheny: &ldquo;Yessor! I can appreciate ahl <i>that.</i> But fwhy did he ask
      her if <i>she</i> was the lady? Fwhy did he ask her if she was a cuke?
      That&rsquo;s what I wannt to know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Campbell: &ldquo;Well, now, I&rsquo;m sure you can understand that. He was naturally a
      good deal embarrassed at having to address a strange lady; his mind was
      full of his wife&rsquo;s cook, and instead of asking her if she&rsquo;d <i>seen</i> a
      cook, he bungled and he blundered, and asked her&mdash;I suppose&mdash;if
      she <i>was</i> a cook. Can&rsquo;t you see that? how it would happen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McIlheny, with conviction: &ldquo;Yessor, I can. And I&rsquo;ll feel it an hannor if
      you gintlemen will join me in a glass of wine on the carner, across the
      way&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Campbell: &ldquo;But your train?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McIlheny: &ldquo;Oh, domn the thrain! But I&rsquo;ll just stip aboord and tell Mrs.
      McIlheny I&rsquo;ve met a frind, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll be out by the next thrain, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll be
      back wid you in a jiffy.&rdquo; He runs out, and Campbell turns to Roberts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roberts: &ldquo;Good heavens, Willis! what are we going to do? Surely, we can&rsquo;t
      go out and drink with this man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Campbell: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t have the pleasure. I&rsquo;m afraid Mrs.
      McIlheny is of a suspicious nature; and when Mr. Mac comes back, it&rsquo;ll be
      to offer renewed hostility instead of renewed hospitality. I don&rsquo;t see
      anything for us but flight, Roberts. Or, <i>you</i> can&rsquo;t fly, you poor
      old fellow! You&rsquo;ve got to stay and look out for that cook. I&rsquo;d be glad to
      stay for you, but, you see, I should not know her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know her either, Willis. I was just thinking whether you
      couldn&rsquo;t manage this wretched man rather better alone. I&mdash;I&rsquo;m afraid
      I confuse you; and he gets things out of me&mdash;admissions, you know&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Campbell: &ldquo;No, no! Your moral support is everything. That lie of mine is
      getting whittled away to nothing; we shall soon be down to the bare truth.
      If it hadn&rsquo;t been for these last admissions of yours, I don&rsquo;t know what I
      should have done. They were a perfect inspiration. I&rsquo;ll tell you what,
      Roberts! I believe you can manage this business twice as well without me.
      But you must keep your eye out for the cook! You mustn&rsquo;t let any
      respectable butter-ball leave the room without asking her if she&rsquo;s the
      one. You&rsquo;ll know how to put it more delicately now. And I won&rsquo;t complicate
      you with McIlheny any more. I&rsquo;ll just step out here&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts: &ldquo;No, no, no! You mustn&rsquo;t go, Willis. You mustn&rsquo;t indeed! I
      shouldn&rsquo;t know what to do with that tipsy nuisance. Ah, here he comes
      again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Campbell, cheerily, to the approaching McIlheny: &ldquo;I hope you didn&rsquo;t lose
      your train, Mr. McIlheny!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McIlheny, darkly: &ldquo;Never moind my thrain, sor! My wife says it was a
      put-up jahb between ye. She says ye were afther laughun&rsquo;, and lukun&rsquo; and
      winkun&rsquo; at her before this mahn slipped up to spake to her. Now what do ye
      make of that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Campbell: &ldquo;We were laughing, of course. I had been laughing at my friend&rsquo;s
      predicament, in being left to meet a lady he&rsquo;d never seen before. You
      laughed at it yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McIlheny: &ldquo;I did, sor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts, basely truckling to him: &ldquo;It was certainly a ludicrous position.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Campbell: &ldquo;And when we explained it, it amused your good lady too. She
      laughed as much as yourself&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McIlheny: &ldquo;She did, sor. Ye&rsquo;re right. Sure it would make a cow laugh.
      Well, gintlemen, ye must excuse me. Mrs. McIlheny says I mustn&rsquo;t stop for
      the next thrain, and I&rsquo;ll have to ask you to join me in that glass of wine
      some other toime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Campbell: &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s all right, Mr. McIlheny. You&rsquo;ve only got about half a
      minute.&rdquo; He glances at the clock, and McIlheny runs out, profusely waving
      his hand in adieu.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roberts, taking out his handkerchief and wiping his forehead: &ldquo;Well, thank
      Heaven! we&rsquo;re rid of him at last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Campbell: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure of that. He&rsquo;ll probably miss the train. You may
      be sure Mrs. McIlheny is waiting for him outside of it, and then we shall
      have them both on our hands indefinitely. We shall have to explain and
      explain. Fiction has entirely failed us, and I feel that the truth is
      giving way under our feet. I&rsquo;ll tell you what, Roberts!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts, in despair: &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Campbell: &ldquo;Why, if McIlheny should happen to come back alone, we mustn&rsquo;t
      wait for him to renew his invitation to drink; we must take him out
      ourselves, and get him drunk; so drunk he can&rsquo;t remember anything; stone
      drunk; dead drunk. Or, that is, <i>you</i> must. I haven&rsquo;t got anything to
      do with him. I wash my hands of the whole affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts: &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t, Willis! You know I can&rsquo;t manage without you. And
      you know I can&rsquo;t take the man out and get him drunk. I couldn&rsquo;t. I
      shouldn&rsquo;t feel that it was right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Campbell: &ldquo;Yes, I know. You&rsquo;d have to drink with him; and you&rsquo;ve got no
      head at all. You&rsquo;d probably get drunk first, and I don&rsquo;t know what I
      should say to Agnes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts: &ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t the point, Willis. I couldn&rsquo;t ask the man to drink; I
      should consider it immoral. Besides, what should you do if the cook came
      while I was away? You wouldn&rsquo;t know her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Campbell: &ldquo;Well, neither would you, if you stayed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be any end of it, or any way
      out of it. I must just stay and bear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Campbell: &ldquo;Of <i>course</i> you must stay. And when McIlheny comes back,
      you&rsquo;d better ask him out to look upon the wine when it is red.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts: &ldquo;No; that&rsquo;s impossible, quite. I shouldn&rsquo;t mind the association&mdash;though
      it isn&rsquo;t very pleasant; but to offer drink to a man already&mdash;Do you
      suppose it would do to ask him out for a glass of soda? Plain soda would
      be good for him. Or I could order claret in it, if the worst came to the
      worst.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Campbell: &ldquo;Claret! What Mr. McIlheny requires is forty-rod whiskey in a
      solution of sulphuric acid. You must take that, or fourth-proof brandy
      straight, with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts, miserably: &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t; you know I couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Campbell: &ldquo;What are you going to do, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; I don&rsquo;t know. I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll give him in charge to a
      policeman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Campbell: &ldquo;And make a scandal here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts: &ldquo;Of course it can&rsquo;t be done!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Campbell: &ldquo;Of <i>course</i> it can&rsquo;t. Give a councilman in charge? The
      policeman will be Irish too, and then what&rsquo;ll you do? You&rsquo;re more likely
      to be carried off yourself, when the facts are explained. They&rsquo;ll have an
      ugly look in the police report.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts: &ldquo;Oh, it can&rsquo;t be done! Nothing can be done! I wish Agnes would
      come!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      V. <i>MRS. ROBERTS, MRS. CAMPBELL, ROBERTS, AND CAMPBELL; THEN THE COOK
      AND McILHENY</i>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mrs. Roberts, rushing in and looking about in a flutter, till she
      discovers her husband: &ldquo;Good gracious, Edward! Is that our train? I ran
      all the way from the station door as fast as I could run, and I&rsquo;m
      perfectly out of breath. Did you ever hear of anything like my meeting Amy
      on the very instant? She was getting out of her coupe just as I was
      getting out of mine, and I saw her the first thing as soon as I looked up.
      It was the most wonderful chance. And the moment we pushed our way through
      the door and got inside the outer hall, I heard the man calling the train&mdash;he
      calls so distinctly&mdash;and I told her I was sure it was our train; and
      then we just simply flew, both of us. I had the greatest time getting my
      plush bag. They were all locked up at Stearns&rsquo;s as tight as a drum, but I
      saw somebody inside, moving about, and I rattled the door, and made signs
      till he came; and then I said I had left my plush bag; and he said it was
      against the rules, and I&rsquo;d have to come Monday; and I told him I knew it
      was, and I didn&rsquo;t expect him to transgress the rules, but I wished very
      much to have my plush bag, because there were some things in it that I
      wished to have, as well as my purse; for I&rsquo;d brought away my keys in it;
      and I knew Willis&mdash;how d&rsquo;ye do, Willis?&mdash;would want wine with
      his dinner, and you&rsquo;d have to break the closet open if I didn&rsquo;t get the
      key; and so he said he would see if the person who kept the picked-up
      things was there yet; and it turned out he was, and he asked me for a
      description of the bag and its contents; and I described them all, down to
      the very last thing; and he said I had the greatest memory he ever saw.
      And now I think everything is going off perfectly, and I shall be able to
      show Amy that there&rsquo;s something inland as well as at the seaside. Why
      don&rsquo;t you speak to her, Edward? What is the matter? What are you looking
      at?&rdquo; She detects him in the act of craning his neck to this side and that,
      and peering over people&rsquo;s heads and shoulders in the direction of the
      door. &ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t Norah&mdash;Bridget, I mean&mdash;come yet?&rdquo; She frowns
      significantly, and cautions him concerning Mrs. Campbell by pressing her
      finger to her lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roberts: &ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes, she&rsquo;s here; I suppose she&rsquo;s&mdash;she&rsquo;s here. How
      do you do, Amy? So glad&mdash;&rdquo; He continues his furtive inspection of the
      door-way, and Willis turns away with a snicker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Campbell: &ldquo;Willis, what are you laughing at? Is there anything wrong
      with my bonnet? Agnes, <i>is</i> there? He would let me go about looking
      like a perfect auk. Did I bang it getting out of the coupe. Do tell me,
      Willis!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Roberts, to her husband: &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say you haven&rsquo;t <i>seen</i>
      her yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts, desperately: &ldquo;Seen her? How should I know whether I&rsquo;ve seen her?
      I never saw her in my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Roberts: &ldquo;Then what are you looking for, in that way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts: &ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m looking for her husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Roberts: &ldquo;Her husband?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts: &ldquo;Yes. He keeps coming back.&rdquo; Campbell bursts into a wild shriek
      of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Roberts, imploringly: &ldquo;Willis, what <i>does</i> it mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Campbell, threateningly: &ldquo;Willis, if you don&rsquo;t behave yourself&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Roberts, with the calm of despair: &ldquo;Well, then, she isn&rsquo;t coming!
      She&rsquo;s given us the slip! I might have known it! Well, the cat might as
      well come out of the bag first as last, Amy, though I was trying to keep
      it in, to spare your feelings; I knew you&rsquo;d be so full of sympathy.&rdquo;
       Suddenly to her husband: &ldquo;But if you saw her husband&mdash;Did he say she
      sent him? I didn&rsquo;t dream of her being married. How do you know it&rsquo;s her
      husband?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts: &ldquo;Because&mdash;because she went out and got him! Don&rsquo;t I tell
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Roberts: &ldquo;Went out and got him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts: &ldquo;When I spoke to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Roberts: &ldquo;When you spoke to her? But you said you didn&rsquo;t see her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts: &ldquo;Of <i>course</i> I didn&rsquo;t see her. How should I see her, when I
      never saw her before? I went up and spoke to her, and she said she wasn&rsquo;t
      the one. She was very angry, and she went out and got her husband. He was
      tipsy, and he&rsquo;s been coming back ever since. I don&rsquo;t know what to do about
      the wretched creature. He says I&rsquo;ve insulted his abominable wife!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Campbell, laughing: &ldquo;O Lord! Lord! This will be the death of me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Campbell: &ldquo;This is one of your tricks, Willis; one of your vile
      practical jokes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Campbell: &ldquo;No, no, my dear! I couldn&rsquo;t invent anything equal to <i>this</i>.
      Oh my! oh my!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Campbell, seizing him by the arm: &ldquo;Well, if you don&rsquo;t tell,
      instantly, what it is&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Campbell: &ldquo;But I <i>can&rsquo;t</i> tell. I promised Roberts I wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts, wildly: &ldquo;Oh, tell, tell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Campbell: &ldquo;About the cook, too, Agnes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Roberts: &ldquo;Yes, yes; everything! Only tell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Campbell, struggling to recover himself: &ldquo;Why, you see, Agnes engaged a
      cook, up-town&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Roberts: &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want you to know it, Amy. I thought you would be
      troubled if you knew you were coming to visit me just when I was trying to
      break in a new cook, and so I told Edward not to let Willis know. Go on,
      Willis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Campbell: &ldquo;And I understand just how you felt about it, Agnes; you
      knew he&rsquo;d laugh. Go on, Willis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Campbell: &ldquo;And she sent her down here, and told Roberts to keep her till
      she came herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both Ladies: &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Campbell: &ldquo;And I found poor old Roberts here, looking out for a cook that
      he&rsquo;d never seen before, and expecting to recognize a woman that he&rsquo;d never
      met in his life.&rdquo; He explodes in another fit of laughter. The ladies stare
      at him in mystification.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Roberts: &ldquo;I would have stayed myself to meet her, but I&rsquo;d left my
      plush bag with my purse in it at Stearns&rsquo;s, and I had to go back after
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Campbell: &ldquo;She <i>had</i> to leave him. What is there to laugh at?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Roberts: &ldquo;I see nothing to laugh at, Willis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Campbell, sobered: &ldquo;You <i>don&rsquo;t</i>?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both Ladies: &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Campbell: &ldquo;Well, by Jove! Then perhaps you don&rsquo;t see anything to laugh at
      in Roberts&rsquo;s having to guess who the cook was; and going up to the wrong
      woman, and her getting mad, and going out and bringing back her little
      fiery-red tipsy Irishman of a husband, that wanted to fight Roberts; and
      my having to lie out of it for him; and their going off again, and the
      husband coming back four or five times between drinks, and having to be
      smoothed up each time&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both Ladies: &ldquo;No!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Roberts: &ldquo;It was simply horrid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Campbell: &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t funny at all; it was simply disgusting. Poor Mr.
      Roberts!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Campbell: &ldquo;Well, by the holy poker! This knocks me out! The next time I&rsquo;ll
      marry a man, and have somebody around that can appreciate a joke. The
      Irishman said himself it would make a cow laugh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Campbell: &ldquo;I congratulate you on being of the same taste, Willis. And
      I dare say you tried to heighten the absurdity, and add to poor Mr.
      Roberts&rsquo;s perplexity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts: &ldquo;No, no! I assure you, Amy, if it hadn&rsquo;t been for Willis, I
      shouldn&rsquo;t have known how to manage. I was quite at my wits&rsquo; end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Campbell: &ldquo;You are very generous, I&rsquo;m sure, Mr. Roberts; and I
      suppose I shall have to believe <i>you</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts: &ldquo;But I couldn&rsquo;t act upon the suggestion to take the man out and
      treat him; Willis was convinced himself, I think, that that wouldn&rsquo;t do.
      But I confess I was tempted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Roberts: &ldquo;Treat him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roberts: &ldquo;Yes. He was rather tipsy already; and Willis thought he would be
      more peaceable perhaps if we could get him quite drunk; but I really
      couldn&rsquo;t bring my mind to it, though I was so distracted that I was on the
      point of yielding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both Ladies: &ldquo;Willis!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Roberts: &ldquo;You wanted poor Edward to go out and drink with that
      wretched being, so as to get him into a still worse state?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Campbell: &ldquo;You suggested that poor Mr. Roberts should do such a thing
      as that? Well, Willis!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Roberts: &ldquo;Well, Willis!&rdquo; She turns from him more in sorrow than in
      anger, and confronts a cook-like person of comfortable bulk, with a bundle
      in her hand, and every mark of hurry and exhaustion in her countenance.
      &ldquo;Why, here&rsquo;s Bridget now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Cook: &ldquo;Maggie, mem! I was afraid I was after missun&rsquo; you, after all. I
      couldn&rsquo;t see the gentleman anywhere, and I&rsquo;ve been runnun&rsquo; up and down the
      depot askun&rsquo; fur um; and at last, thinks I, I&rsquo;ll try the ladies&rsquo; room; and
      sure enough here ye was yourself. It was lucky I thought of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Roberts: &ldquo;Oh! I forgot to tell you he&rsquo;d be in the ladies&rsquo; room. But
      it&rsquo;s all right now, Maggie; and we&rsquo;ve just got time to catch our train.&rdquo;
     </p>

      Campbell, bitterly: &ldquo;Well, Agnes, for a woman that&rsquo;s set so many people by
      the ears, you let yourself up pretty easily. By Jove! here comes that
      fellow back again!&rdquo; They all mechanically shrink aside, and leave Roberts
      exposed to the approach of McIlheny.

      never put her hands in wather, and had hilpers to milk her father&rsquo;s cows?
      What did ye mane, sor? Did she luke like a lady, or did she luke like a
      cuke? Tell me that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Cook, bursting upon him from behind Roberts, who eagerly gives place
      to her: &ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;ll</i> tell ye that meself, ye impidint felly! What&rsquo;s to
      kape a cuke from lukun&rsquo; like a lady, or a lady from lukun&rsquo; like a cuke?

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

1.B.  &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, &ldquo;Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.&rdquo;
 
- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
